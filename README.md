# powell-project-ideas
A list of projects I'll never get around to.

## Podiobook: player that treats podcast feed as an audiobook (plays start-to-finish, remembers what episode you're on)

### Motivation
My original non-trivial Android app. Used to learn & practice new concepts in Android development

### Goal
None, just to practice. Also
- [ ] A kotlin library for accessing the Itunes Search API suitable for use on a mobile device.
- [ ] A kotlin library for parsing Podcast RSS feeds suitable for use on a mobile device.
- [ ] A blog post on the structure of the tables used to manage this application
- [ ] A blog post on the architecture of the app. It's use cases meant adapting the current treat of Clean Architecture, MVVM and Repositories into something unique.

## Telegraph: Twitter, but user posts are published 5 days later.

### Motivation
I'm familiar with a lot of web app concepts from contributions throughout my career, but I'd like to say I've actually built something.

### Goals
Success looks like 1) a locally-deployable cloud development environment, 2) a CRUD enpoint for creating "tweets" 3) hands-on experience (not just mere familiarity, but solving problems) with the following technologies:

- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Personal Resume: my education, qualificatins and experience listed using increasingly over-engineered methods
  - [ ] HTML Resume
  - [ ] HTML + CSS Resume
  - [ ] HTML + CSS + JS Resume
  - [ ] REST API for accessing Resume
  - [ ] REST API for administrating Resume
  - [ ] Dockerized Resume

## SIA (Sentry Integration Actors): IoT framework that binds sentries (sensors) and actors (things that change things like smart lightbulbs, theromostat) 

### Motivation
I have several microcontrollers that do things like record humidity. I have smart devices I can turn on/off with an API. I want to make them talk to one another using a protocol I don't have to think too much about (when connecting/disconnecting them. Considerable thought will be had designing this.)


## Tuner: guitar/violin tuner mobile app

## TwinCalc clone

## Tabletop dice roller: 1d20 1d6 and everything in-between.

### Motivation
refresh concepts from compiler design like parsers, non-context grammars, abstract syntax trees, etc

### Goal 
Mobile app where user can enter a dice roll instruction, see the evaluated result and the rolls that comprised it.
